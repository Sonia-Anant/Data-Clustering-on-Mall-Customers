The shops/mall will be least interested in people belonging to this cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cluster 2(blue colored) we can see that people have low income but higher spending scores, these are those people who for some reason love to buy products more often even though they have a low income. Maybe it’s because these people are more than satisfied with the mall services. The shops/malls might not target these people that effectively but still will not lose them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cluster 5(red colored) we see that people have average income and an average spending score, these people again will not be the prime targets of the shops or mall, but again they will be considered and other data analysis techniques may be used to increase their spending score.\n",

    "In cluster 1(violet colored) we see that people have high income and high spending scores, this is the ideal case for the mall or shops as these people are the prime sources of profit. These people might be the regular customers of the mall and are convinced by the mall’s facilities.\n",

    "In cluster 3(green colored) we see that people have high income but low spending scores, this is interesting. Maybe these are the people who are unsatisfied or unhappy by the mall’s services. These can be the prime targets of the mall, as they have the potential to spend money. So, the mall authorities will try to add new \n",
